# Changelog

All notable changes to TITrack will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Clickable item links in the overlay**: Item names in the overlay loot list are now hyperlinks that open the corresponding tlidb.com page in the default browser, matching the behavior of the dashboard inventory / run details / current run / loot report. Links automatically follow the active language (`/en/` vs `/cn/`) and fall back to deriving `https://tlidb.com/{en|cn}/<NameWithUnderscores>` from the item's English name when the database has no stored URL.

### Changed
- **Faster dashboard refresh**: The web dashboard now polls `/api/*` every 2 seconds instead of every 5 seconds, matching the overlay. Loot pickups, current-run value, and inventory now appear within ~2 s of being logged by the game (previously up to 5 s).
- **Overlay loot list is no longer fully click-through**: The `SlimScrollViewer` template that hosts the loot list previously had `IsHitTestVisible="False"` on its content presenter. That was originally to let mouse clicks pass through to the game, but it also blocked the new item-name hyperlinks. Hit-testing is now enabled on the loot list. The header drag area and the stats grid remain click-through as before. Use the 🔒 (lock) button to make the entire overlay click-through again if you need it.

### Fixed
- **Cloud sync silently disabled in packaged builds**: The `/api/cloud/status` endpoint was returning `cloud_available: false` even with the toggle enabled, so queued price submissions never uploaded. Two root causes:
  1. The `supabase` package wasn't installed in the build venv, so the EXE shipped without it.
  2. supabase 2.30+ renamed two of its subpackages (`gotrue` → `supabase_auth`, `supafunc` → `supabase_functions`), but `ti_tracker.spec` still listed the old names as hidden imports. PyInstaller therefore didn't bundle the new packages even when they were installed.
  Fixed by adding the new package names (and `h2`/`hpack`/`hyperframe` for the realtime websocket dependency) to `ti_tracker.spec` and ensuring `supabase>=2.0.0` is installed in the build environment before packaging.

### Build notes

To produce a working release build with cloud sync enabled, the build environment must include:

```bash
# Python 3.12 venv (Python 3.14 has no pythonnet wheel yet)
py -3.12 -m venv .venv-build
.\.venv-build\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -e .
pip install pyinstaller "supabase>=2.0.0"

# Build the WPF overlay (must be built before the main app)
dotnet publish overlay/TITrackOverlay.csproj -c Release -o overlay/publish

# Build the main EXE — picks up overlay/publish/TITrackOverlay.exe automatically
python -m PyInstaller ti_tracker.spec --noconfirm
```

`ti_tracker.spec` hidden imports for cloud sync now include both old and new
supabase package names so the same spec works against supabase 2.x ≤ 2.29 and
supabase ≥ 2.30:

```python
'supabase', 'gotrue', 'supabase_auth',
'postgrest', 'realtime', 'storage3',
'supafunc', 'supabase_functions',
'h2', 'hpack', 'hyperframe',
```

Verify the EXE actually shipped supabase by hitting `/api/cloud/status` after
launch; `cloud_available` must be `true`.

## [0.5.9] - 2026-04-24

### Added
- **Install location warning**: TITrack now detects when it's installed inside a cloud-synced folder (OneDrive, Dropbox, Google Drive, iCloud Drive, pCloud, Box Sync, MEGA) or under Program Files and warns before applying an auto-update. These locations can silently revert or redirect the updated files, leaving the user stuck on the old version after restart. The warning appears in the update modal and is logged at startup for support diagnosis.
- **Character detection diagnostics**: Replaced the generic "Waiting for character detection..." message with a panel that explains *why* detection hasn't happened yet. It distinguishes a missing/invalid log path, a log that doesn't look like a Torchlight log, a stale log (game closed or logging disabled), a log that's active but awaiting login, and — the common case — the user has both the Steam and standalone client installed and TITrack is watching the wrong one's log. When a newer `UE_game.log` is found elsewhere, the panel surfaces a one-click "Switch to newer log" button that pre-fills the settings modal with the suggested path so the user can confirm before saving.
- **Character detection troubleshooting in the modal**: Rewrote the "Character Not Detected" modal to walk users through the actual fix instead of generic advice. New sections explain how detection works, a "Try this first" tiered recipe (toggle Enable Log in-game → exit to Select Character → log back in — no client restart needed in the common case), a fallback recipe that includes a full client restart for the truncated-packet edge case, and a cleaned-up "Other things to check" list covering dual-client installs, game-closed state, and the fact that Enable Log resets every client session. The underlying header summary messages were also updated to stop suggesting "click Sort" as the primary fix, since sort alone doesn't help when logging was off at login time.
- **SS12 Lunaria items**: Added 60 new Lunaria-season items to the item seed — 8 new compasses (Vorax, Creation, Colorful Fluorescent Artifact, Mystery Treasure Gods lines), 3 seasonal Lunar Stone compasses, 2 Dual Kismet Destiny Fates, 3 Lunar Dust currencies, 45 Memory Revival Materials (Moon Phase), and 2 misc (Moonlit Thread - Epic, Lunar Fragment). Also replaced 3 stale entries at IDs 10290–10292 that had been recycled by the game engine from a prior season's Scalpel compass line to the current Vorax Compass variants. The 8 new regular compasses automatically participate in the low-map-supply alert system; seasonal compasses (`type_cn=赛季罗盘`) remain outside the compass alert category, matching prior behavior. Seed count: 1824 → 1884.

---

## [0.5.8] - 2026-04-22

### Fixed
- **App fails to launch after first run**: Some users reported the app launching successfully once, then on subsequent launches appearing as `titrack.exe` in Task Manager with no UI. Root cause: when Supabase was unhealthy (e.g., HTTP 5xx or DNS failure), the initial cloud-sync price download ran synchronously on the startup thread with no timeout, blocking uvicorn and the native window from ever starting. The initial download now runs in a background daemon thread so an unhealthy cloud backend can no longer block app startup.

---

## [0.5.7] - 2026-04-16

### Fixed
- **SS12 Lunaria compatibility**: Drops and inventory sorts weren't being detected after the season launch because the game's Unreal log category prefix changed from `GameLog:` to `TLLua:` (bag/item events) and `TLShipping:` (level events). Parser patterns now accept any log category, keeping backward compatibility with older logs.

### Added
- **Season name mapping**: SeasonId 1401 now displays as "SS12 Lunaria" in the dashboard header.

---

## [0.5.6] - 2026-02-21

### Added
- **Cloud Oasis (Sandlord) loot tracking**: Push2 events from airship/glider rewards in Cloud Oasis and Quicksand Treasure Stash zones are now tracked as loot deltas. Previously, Push2 was globally excluded as a non-loot proto name.
- **Sandlord run segmentation**: Cloud Oasis and Quicksand Treasure Stash zones form one continuous run. Transitioning between them no longer ends/starts a new run.
- **Bound item support**: Added 13 bound (untradeable) currency variants to the items database — Flame Sand, Flame Elementium, all 4 Embers, Elixir of Oblivion, Netherrealm Resonance, Winding Key, Twin Reflection, Sprout of Legends, Deep Space Resonance, and Energy Core. Bound items are always valued at 0 FE.
- **Low Map Supply Alerts**: Configurable per-item alerts that notify when a specific consumed supply item drops to a threshold. Only items you've actually used as map costs (beacons, compasses, resonance) are monitored — unused items won't trigger alerts. Set thresholds per category in Settings (0 to disable). Dashboard shows amber toast (15s); full overlay shows amber banner (15s); micro overlay shows ⚠ icon with tooltip (15s). Alerts trigger once per item and re-arm when quantity goes back above threshold.
- **Incremental item seeding**: Items seed now runs every startup with INSERT OR IGNORE, so existing databases automatically pick up newly added items without requiring a reset.

### Fixed
- **Quicksand Treasure Stash zone name**: Fixed incorrect zone name display (was showing "Thunder Wastes - Defiled Oasis" due to shared map path). Now correctly resolved via LevelId.
- **Hidden items lost between sessions**: Fixed player identity inconsistency that could cause hidden items, ignored runs, and ignored report items to become inaccessible across app restarts. When the game log was missing PlayerId (e.g., after log rotation), the app used a name-based fallback ID that differed from the actual player ID used in previous sessions. Now persists the known player ID mapping in settings and automatically migrates per-player data when the ID format changes.
- **Runs empty after delayed character detection**: Fixed PlayerId being lost during live player detection when the app starts with no player context (e.g., game log rotated overnight). Name+SeasonId triggered an initial detection that cleared pending data before PlayerId arrived, locking the app to a fallback ID that didn't match stored runs. PlayerId now continues accumulating and corrects the effective ID automatically.
- **Hidden items not restored on player change**: Fixed frontend not reloading hidden items when the player context transitions from "no player" to a detected player. The hidden items set was only loaded once at startup and never refreshed on player change.

---

## [0.5.5] - 2026-02-18

### Fixed
- **Relog no longer clears run data**: Fixed race condition where relogging the same character caused all runs and stats to disappear. The game writes Name, SeasonId, and PlayerId on separate log lines; the collector was triggering a player change before PlayerId arrived, creating a mismatched identity that hid all existing data. Data was never deleted but became invisible until app restart. Bug existed since v0.2.8 (multi-character support).
- **Window position on secondary/portrait monitors**: Fixed bounds check incorrectly rejecting saved window positions for maximized windows on secondary monitors. Maximized windows on Windows 10/11 extend ~8px beyond monitor edges (shadow area), which the old virtual-screen math rejected as "off-screen". Also fixed DPI double-division that could reject valid positions at >100% scaling. Now uses `MonitorFromPoint` Win32 API for reliable multi-monitor detection.

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-02-18

### Added
- **Ignore Items in Loot Report**: Eye icon toggle on each item row to exclude specific item types from report totals, chart, and percentages. Ignored items shown with strikethrough and dimmed styling. Totals, profit, and rates recalculate instantly on toggle. Items ignored in individual runs are automatically pre-ignored in the report. Per-character, persists across sessions, cleared on stats reset.
- **Recent Runs Scrolling**: Recent Runs table now scrolls within a fixed-height container (600px) with sticky header, keeping the page layout stable when many runs are listed.
- **Charts Use In-Map Time by Default**: Chart x-axis now shows cumulative in-map time (e.g., "1h", "2h 30m") instead of wall-clock time, eliminating misleading gaps from idle periods. When Real-Time Tracking is enabled, charts switch back to wall-clock timestamps.

### Fixed
- **Main window bounds checking**: Window position is validated against virtual screen bounds on restore. If the saved position is off-screen (e.g., disconnected monitor), it resets to center instead of opening invisibly.

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-02-17

### Added
- **Inventory Tab Filter**: Filter inventory by in-game tab (All, Gear, Skill, Commodity, Others) via a filter icon next to the "Hide Items" button. Net worth always reflects the full inventory regardless of filter selection.

### Fixed
- **Charts not subtracting map costs**: Cumulative Value and FE/Hour charts were showing gross loot values instead of net values when Map Costs setting was enabled, causing them to be inflated compared to the stats header
- **Trade house events affecting chart values**: Run value calculations (used by charts, stats, and loot report) now exclude trade house proto names (`Push2`, `XchgReceive`, `ExchangeItem`, `XchgRecall`, `XchgForSale`) and skill management (`UnequipSkill`) at the SQL query level as defense-in-depth, preventing any legacy deltas from inflating values

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-02-16

### Added
- **Ignore Runs & Items**: Exclude outlier runs or specific items from all calculations (FE/Hour, FE/Map, charts, loot report)
  - "Ignore Run" button in run details modal to exclude entire runs
  - Per-item ignore toggles (eye icon) to exclude specific item types within a run
  - Ignored runs shown with strikethrough + dimmed styling in the Recent Runs table
  - Runs with ignored items show indicator icon next to the Details button
  - Data cleared on stats reset
- **Main window state persistence**: Dashboard window remembers its position, size, and maximized state across restarts
  - Supports multi-monitor setups (e.g., maximized on second monitor)
  - Position and size saved on move/resize; maximized state saved on close
- **Overlay state persistence**: Overlay remembers its position, size, and transparency across restarts
  - Normal and micro overlay positions saved independently
  - Position validated against screen bounds on restore (falls back to default if off-screen)

### Changed
- Renamed "Value/Hour" to "FE/Hour" and "Value/Map" to "FE/Map" across dashboard, overlay, and micro overlay
- **Overlay default mode is fully opaque**: Removed background transparency from the full overlay's default (non-transparent) mode; use the transparency toggle button for transparent background

### Fixed
- **Window position not restored on correct monitor**: Fixed pywebview DPI scaling asymmetry where saved window coordinates were multiplied by the display scale factor on every restore, causing the window to drift off-screen. Now stores logical (DPI-adjusted) coordinates for correct multi-monitor round-tripping.
- **Skill equip/unequip counted as loot**: Unequipping a skill during a map created a false loot drop; re-equipping created a false negative delta. Events with proto name `UnequipSkill` and events outside any proto block now update inventory without creating deltas.
- **Trade house listings counted as negative loot**: Listing an item for sale (`XchgForSale`) during a map was counted as losing loot. Now updates inventory without creating deltas.
- **Overlay lock button background not transparent**: When the overlay was locked while in transparent mode, the floating unlock button retained its opaque background instead of matching the transparent overlay style

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-02-15

### Fixed
- **Micro overlay horizontal mode**: Window now auto-sizes to fit all stats instead of cutting them off at a fixed width
- **Overlay total time**: Timer now counts smoothly second-by-second while inside a map, instead of only updating when leaving a map

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-15

### Added
- **Micro Overlay Mode**: Compact alternative to the full overlay showing only selected stats in a minimal bar
  - Toggle between full and micro overlay in Settings → Overlay
  - Horizontal (wide bar) or Vertical (narrow column) layout options
  - Font size slider (70%–160%)
  - Clickable chips to select and drag-to-reorder visible stats (Time, FE/hr, Total, NW, Run, Val/Map, Runs, Avg)
  - Transparency toggle, lock (click-through), and close buttons
- **Overlay lock (click-through)**: New lock button on the full overlay makes the entire window click-through, passing all clicks to the game underneath. A floating unlock button appears to restore interactivity.
- **Supreme Showdown zone name**: Floors now display as "Supreme Showdown" instead of raw internal paths

---

## [0.4.9] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Gear tab allowlist**: Destiny items (Fates, Kismets), Prisms, and Divinity items (Pacts, Fragments, God Divinities) are now tracked from the Gear tab despite the general gear exclusion. These item types have stable, tradeable prices. Configured via `ALLOWED_GEAR_TYPE_CN` in `inventory.py` — 263 items across 14 type categories.
- **Deep Space zone names**: Boundless Hunting Ground, Core Mine, Desert Pasture, Barren Wilderness, Vast Wasteland
- **Hide Items search**: Search bar in the Hide Items modal to quickly filter items by name

### Fixed
- **Cancelled trade house listings counted as loot**: Removing a listing from the trade house while inside a map no longer inflates drop counts. The `XchgRecall` proto name is now excluded from loot tracking.
- **Active run continuity across sub-zones**: When returning from Nightmare or Arcana (Fateful Contest) sub-zones, the Current Run panel now correctly resumes the original map's timer and loot instead of starting fresh. Timer only counts time in the normal map (excludes sub-zone time). Entering a sub-zone still shows it as a separate active run with its own timer and loot.
- **Active run timer not resetting between maps**: Running the same zone consecutively no longer carries over the previous run's timer into the new run

---

## [0.4.8] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- Abyssal Vault secret realm zone name
- **Economy button**: Opens titrack.ninja economy website from the dashboard header
- **Clickable item names**: Inventory and loot report item names now link to titrack.ninja/item/{id} for detailed price data
- **Ko-fi link**: Footer link to help cover server costs

### Changed
- Overlay no longer takes a separate slot in the Windows taskbar
- Sparkline clicks now open titrack.ninja item page in browser instead of local price history modal

### Removed
- Local price history modal (replaced by titrack.ninja economy website)

### Fixed
- Browser fallback crash when WebView2/EdgeChromium is unavailable (affected users with MOTW-blocked DLLs since v0.2.0)

---

## [0.4.7] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Cumulative Value stat**: New stat in the dashboard header between Net Worth and Value/Hour showing total loot value across all runs.
- **Exclude Hidden Items from Net Worth**: New toggle in the "Hide Items" modal lets you choose whether hidden items count toward net worth. Off by default (existing behavior preserved). When enabled, hidden items are excluded from net worth calculations.
- **Fateful Contest (Arcana)**: Added zone name translation for the Arcana league mechanic sub-zone (`SuMingTaLuo`). Entering Fateful Contest from within a map no longer splits the map into two separate runs — the surrounding map segments are recombined, matching existing Nightmare/Twinightmare behavior.
- **Path of the Brave support**: Runs now display as "Path of the Brave" instead of the boss arena name. Proof of the Brave item consumption is tracked as map costs (requires Map Costs setting enabled).
- **Trial of Divinity**: Added zone name translation for the Trial of Divinity (`KD_JuLiShiLian000`).

---

## [0.4.6] - 2026-02-10

### Added
- **Hide Items from Inventory**: New "Hide Items" button on the inventory panel lets you hide items you don't care about (e.g., beacons bought for mapping). Hidden items are removed from the inventory list but still count toward net worth. Per-character, persists across sessions.

### Fixed
- **Overlay Resize Snap-Back**: Fixed overlay window snapping back to its default size after the user resized it, caused by the hide-loot setting check resetting the height every 2 seconds
- **Zone Name**: Added translation for Secret Realm - Sea of Rites (`HD_EMengZhiXia`)
- **Auto-Updater File Lock**: Added retry loop to verify `TITrack.exe` is unlocked before overwriting during update, preventing potential update failures on slower systems

### Improved
- **Overlay Responsive Padding**: Overlay padding and margins now scale proportionally when the window is resized smaller, allowing a much more compact layout (minimum width reduced from 280px to 180px)

---

## [0.4.5] - 2026-02-08

### Fixed
- **Trade House Sales Counted as Map Loot**: Fixed collecting trade house (Exchange) sales while inside a map being counted as loot drops, skewing Value/Hour, Value/Map, and loot report stats. Events with proto names `Push2` and `XchgReceive` now update inventory (net worth) without creating deltas.
- **Item Recycling Counted as Map Loot**: Fixed recycling items (e.g., memories → Memory Thread) while inside a map being counted as loot drops. The `ExchangeItem` proto name is now excluded from delta tracking.
- **Broken Native Window Rendering**: Fixed pywebview silently falling back to MSHTML (Internet Explorer) when WebView2 is unavailable, rendering unstyled HTML with non-functional buttons. Now forces EdgeChromium and falls back to browser mode with a message box linking to the WebView2 Runtime download.
- **FE Price Spike in Sparklines**: Fixed bad cloud submissions for FE (Flame Elementium) causing price chart spikes. FE is the base currency (always 1:1) and is now excluded from cloud sync uploads, downloads, and history entirely.
- **Skill Item Names**: Fixed 543 skill items showing internal icon-filename placeholders (e.g., `SkillIcon_Support_ProtectWhenChanneling`) instead of proper English names (e.g., "Guard"). All 6 skill categories updated: Active, Support, Passive, Activation Medium, Magnificent, and Noble. Existing users get corrected names automatically on next launch.
- **Zone Names**: Added translations for Unholy Pedestal (Secret Realm) and Mistville (legacy league mechanic) zones that were showing internal Chinese names.

---

## [0.4.4] - 2026-02-07

### Fixed
- **Emoji Character Names**: Fixed game log switching to UTF-16 encoding when player names contain emoji characters, which broke log parsing entirely
- **Auto-Updater Skipping Overlay**: Fixed auto-updater failing to update TITrackOverlay.exe when the overlay was still running during update (Windows file lock). The updater now kills the overlay process before applying the update, with a fallback taskkill in the batch script.
- **Blank White Window on Startup**: Fixed native window sometimes showing all-white with no functional buttons, caused by pywebview opening before the server was ready. Replaced fixed 500ms sleep with a poll loop that waits for the server to be fully started (up to 10 seconds).
- **Map Cost Not Tracked When Last Item Consumed**: Fixed compass/beacon cost not being recorded when using the last one in a stack. The game logs `BagMgr@:RemoveBagItem` instead of the normal `Modfy BagItem` when a slot is fully emptied. Added a parser for this line format.

---

## [0.4.3] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Cloud Sync RPC Function**: Server-side function for efficient price history downloads, reducing bandwidth from ~38MB to ~1-2MB per sync
- **Cloud Sync Logging**: Sync operations now log to titrack.log for easier debugging

### Fixed
- **Character Detection on Startup**: Fixed race condition where collector thread started before player change callback was wired up, causing character detection to fail until app restart
- **Character Pre-Seeding**: App now detects character from existing log on startup instead of always waiting for a fresh login
- **Cloud Sync Price Download**: Fixed cloud prices not downloading when toggling sync on, caused by season context not being set from pre-seeded player info
- **Cloud Sync Data Truncation**: Fixed Supabase's 1000-row default limit silently truncating price and history downloads, causing missing prices and empty sparklines
- **Cloud Sync History Efficiency**: History downloads now only fetch data for items in the user's inventory instead of all community-priced items (~124 items vs ~1500+)
- **Large Log File Handling**: Fixed character detection failing on large game logs by reading last 5MB first with fallback to full scan

### Changed
- **Updated Instructions**: Help text and README updated to reflect automatic character detection from existing game logs (no relog required for returning users)

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- **Real-Time Tracking Mode**: Optional wall-clock time tracking for Value/Hour and Total Time
  - Toggle in Settings → "Real-Time Tracking"
  - When enabled, Total Time counts wall-clock elapsed time from first run start instead of summed in-map durations
  - Value/Hour reflects actual session productivity including town/hideout downtime
  - Avg Run Time always uses in-map duration regardless of mode
  - Value/Hour chart uses wall-clock window duration when enabled
- **Pause Button**: Pause/resume tracking during breaks (appears when Real-Time Tracking is enabled)
  - Shows next to Total Time in the dashboard header
  - Also available in the WPF overlay header
  - Paused time is excluded from all calculations
  - Pause state is cleared on stats reset
- **New API Endpoint**: `POST /api/runs/pause` - Toggle realtime tracking pause on/off
- **Overlay Settings Section**: New section in Settings modal for overlay-specific options
  - **Hide Loot Pickups**: Toggle to hide the loot section in the overlay for a compact stats-only view
  - Overlay auto-resizes to fit when loot is hidden
- **Auto-Update Check on Startup**: Silently checks for updates when the app launches and shows a notification modal if a new version is available
- **Discord Link**: Added Discord invite link in the dashboard footer

### Changed
- **Total Time Display**: Now shows seconds (e.g., "2h 15m 30s" instead of "2h 15m") in dashboard and overlay
- **Smooth Time Ticking**: Both dashboard and overlay count Total Time second-by-second locally without extra backend requests

### Fixed
- **Fluorescent Memory Items**: Fixed 17 items showing untranslated placeholder names
- **Cloud Price Downloads**: Fixed cloud prices not downloading immediately on fresh install

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-05

### Added

#### Overlay Improvements
- **Font Scaling**: A-/A+ buttons to adjust text size (70%-160% range)
  - Setting is persisted and restored when overlay reopens
- **Scrollable Loot List**: Slim dark-themed scrollbar for long loot lists
  - Scrollbar remains interactive while loot content is click-through
- **High-Quality Icons**: Improved bitmap scaling for sharper item icons

#### Setup.exe Improvements
- **Auto-Detect Existing Installation**: When updating via Setup.exe, it now checks common locations and desktop shortcuts for existing TITrack installations and defaults to that path to preserve user data

### Changed
- **Cloud Oasis**: Changed from hub zone back to normal trackable zone (Sandlord content where players earn FE)

### Fixed
- **Settings Persistence After Auto-Update**: Fixed database path resolution using `cwd()` instead of app directory, which caused settings (trade tax, map costs) to be lost after updates
- **Database Migration**: Added migration logic to find and recover databases from legacy locations when updating from older versions
- **Log Directory Priority**: Saved log directory setting now takes priority over auto-detection (fixes F: drive and non-standard install locations)
- **Log Path Capitalization**: Added alternate path pattern for different folder capitalizations (TorchLight vs Torchlight)
- **Trade Tax on Map Costs**: Fixed trade tax being incorrectly applied to consumed items (compass/beacon costs)

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-04

### Added

#### WPF Overlay Enhancements
- **Previous Run Preservation**: When a map ends, the overlay now keeps showing the loot and "This Run" value instead of clearing. The label changes to "Previous Run" and the timer stops at the final duration.
- **Click-Through Data Boxes**: Stats grid and loot section are now click-through, allowing interaction with the game underneath. Header (drag), buttons, and resize grip remain interactive.

#### New Zone Translations
- **Rusted Abyss**: Boss zone (`YJ_XiuShiShenYuan`)
- **Cloud Oasis**: Season 10 hub zone (`YunDuanLvZhou`) - now properly detected as hub
- **Ruins of Aeterna: Boundless**: Season 10 content (`CC1_SiWangMiCheng`)
- **The Frozen Canvas**: Season 10 content (`XueYuRongLu`)

### Changed

#### Overlay Display Improvements
- **FE Values**: Now display with 2 decimal places (e.g., "1,234.56") to match main app precision
- **Net Worth**: Rounded to whole number for cleaner display
- **Color Swap**: FE value column is now green, quantity column is gray (swapped for better visual hierarchy)

#### Zone Detection Fixes
- **Demiman Village**: Fixed suffix from 36 to 02, now correctly shows "Glacial Abyss - Demiman Village" at all Timemark levels

### Fixed

- **Trade Tax Calculation Bug**: Individual loot item values now include trade tax when enabled, matching the gross total. Previously items showed pre-tax values but the total was post-tax, causing apparent math errors.
- **Database Locking Crash**: Fixed race condition where concurrent database access from overlay polling and collector writes could cause "database locked" errors. All transactions now properly coordinate through a single threading lock.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

#### Web Dashboard
- FastAPI backend with REST API
- Browser-based dashboard at `http://localhost:8000`
- Real-time stats display: Total FE, Net Worth, Value/Hour, Runs, Prices
- Interactive charts using Chart.js:
  - Cumulative Value over time
  - Value/Hour over time (rolling 1-hour window)
- Recent Runs table with total loot value per run
- Run details modal showing loot breakdown with quantities and FE values
- Sortable inventory panel (click Qty/Value headers to sort)
- Auto-refresh every 5 seconds (toggleable)
- Dark theme matching game aesthetic

#### Exchange Price Learning
- `ExchangeMessageParser` for multi-line exchange protocol messages
- Parses `XchgSearchPrice` send/receive messages from game logs
- Correlates requests (item searched) with responses (price listings)

- Calculates reference price using 10th percentile of listings
- Stores learned prices with `source="exchange"`
- Console output when prices are learned: `[Price] Item Name: 0.021000 FE`

#### Value-Based Calculations
- Run value = raw FE + sum(item_qty × item_price) for priced items
- Value/Hour stat using total loot value instead of raw FE
- Net worth = Total FE + valued inventory items
- Loot details show both quantity and FE value per item
- Items without prices show "no price" indicator

#### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/status` - Server status, collector state, counts
- `GET /api/runs` - Paginated runs with `total_value` field
- `GET /api/runs/{id}` - Single run with loot breakdown

- `GET /api/inventory` - Inventory with sort params (`sort_by`, `sort_order`)
- `GET /api/items` - Item database with search
- `GET /api/prices` - All learned prices
- `PUT /api/prices/{id}` - Update/create price
- `GET /api/stats/history` - Time-series data for charts

#### CLI
- `serve` command to start web server with background collector
- Options: `--port`, `--host`, `--no-browser`
- Graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C

#### Infrastructure
- Thread-safe database connections with locking
- Separate DB connections for collector and API
- Pydantic schemas for API request/response validation
- CORS middleware for local development
- Static file serving for dashboard

### Changed
- Dependencies: Added `fastapi>=0.109.0`, `uvicorn[standard]>=0.27.0`
- Collector now accepts `on_price_update` callback
- Repository adds `get_run_value()` method for value calculations

### Fixed
- Variable shadowing bug in runs API that caused runs to disappear
- FE currency now correctly valued at 1:1 in inventory and loot displays
