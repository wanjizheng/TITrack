# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TITrack is a **Torchlight Infinite Local Loot Tracker** - a Windows desktop application that reads game log files to track loot, calculate profit per map run, and display net worth. Inspired by WealthyExile (Path of Exile tracker).

**Key constraints:**
- Fully local, no cloud/internet required
- Portable EXE distribution (no Python/Node install needed)
- Privacy-focused (all data stored locally)
- No cheating/hooking/memory reading - only parses log files

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python 3.11+
- **Backend:** FastAPI + Uvicorn
- **Database:** SQLite (WAL mode)
- **Frontend:** React (or HTML/HTMX for MVP)
- **Packaging:** PyInstaller (--onedir preferred)
- **Target:** Windows 10/11

# Build WPF Overlay (must be built before main app)
dotnet publish overlay/TITrackOverlay.csproj -c Release -o overlay/publish

# Build main application (PyInstaller) - includes overlay if built
python -m PyInstaller ti_tracker.spec --noconfirm

# Build TITrack-Setup.exe (C# portable extractor)
dotnet publish setup/TITrackSetup.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o setup/publish

# Development server
python -m titrack serve
python -m titrack serve --no-window    # Browser mode (for debugging)
```

## Release Process

Each release includes two files:
- `TITrack-Setup.exe` - Recommended for users (avoids Windows MOTW security issues)
- `TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip` - For advanced users who prefer manual extraction

### Steps to Release

1. **Update version** in both files:
   - `pyproject.toml` → `version = "x.x.x"`
   - `src/titrack/version.py` → `__version__ = "x.x.x"`

2. **Build WPF overlay** (self-contained, ~154 MB):
   ```bash
   dotnet publish overlay/TITrackOverlay.csproj -c Release -o overlay/publish
   ```

3. **Build main application**:
   ```bash
   python -m PyInstaller ti_tracker.spec --noconfirm
   ```

4. **Copy overlay to dist** (PyInstaller may not include large files reliably):
   ```bash
   cp overlay/publish/TITrackOverlay.exe dist/TITrack/
   ```

5. **Create ZIP**:
   ```powershell
   Compress-Archive -Path dist\TITrack -DestinationPath dist\TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip -Force
   ```

6. **Build Setup.exe**:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish setup/TITrackSetup.csproj -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained false -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o setup/publish
   ```

7. **Commit, tag, and push**:
   ```bash
   git add -A && git commit -m "Release vx.x.x"
   git tag vx.x.x && git push origin master && git push origin vx.x.x
   ```

8. **Create GitHub release** with both files. Release notes MUST end with a download footer:
   ```bash
   gh release create vx.x.x setup/publish/TITrack-Setup.exe dist/TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip --title "vx.x.x" --notes "Release notes here"
   ```
   **Required footer** (append to all release notes):
   ```
   ---

   **Download:** Use `TITrack-Setup.exe` (recommended) or extract `TITrack-x.x.x-windows.zip` manually.
   ```

### Code Signing (Optional)

If you have an OV/EV code signing certificate:
```powershell
# Sign both executables
signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 /a "setup\publish\TITrack-Setup.exe"
signtool sign /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td sha256 /fd sha256 /a "dist\TITrack\TITrack.exe"
```

Sign before creating the ZIP and uploading to GitHub.

## Setup Project (TITrack-Setup.exe)

Located in `setup/` folder. A lightweight C# WinForms application (~174 KB) that:
- Downloads the latest release ZIP from GitHub
- Extracts to user-chosen location (portable, no installation)
- Avoids Mark of the Web (MOTW) issues since programmatic downloads aren't marked
- Optional desktop shortcut creation

The Setup.exe automatically fetches the latest release from GitHub API, so it doesn't need rebuilding for every release unless functionality changes.

**Requirements to build**: .NET 8 SDK (`winget install Microsoft.DotNet.SDK.8`)

## Architecture

Five main components:

1. **Collector (Log Tailer + Parser)** - Watches TI log file, parses events, computes item deltas
2. **Local Database (SQLite)** - Stores runs, deltas, slot state, prices, settings
3. **Price Engine** - Maps ConfigBaseId to price_fe, learns prices from Exchange searches
4. **Local Web UI** - FastAPI serves REST API + static files, opens in browser
5. **Packaged App** - PyInstaller EXE that starts all services

## Key Data Concepts

- **FE (Flame Elementium):** Primary valuation currency, ConfigBaseId = `100300`
- **ConfigBaseId:** Integer item type identifier from game logs
- **Delta tracking:** Logs report absolute stack totals (`Num=`), tracker computes changes vs previous state
- **Slot state:** Tracked per `(PageId, SlotId)` with current `(ConfigBaseId, Num)`

## Log Parsing

**Log file locations (auto-detected):**
- **Steam:** `<SteamLibrary>\steamapps\common\Torchlight Infinite\UE_Game\Torchlight\Saved\Logs\UE_game.log`
- **Standalone client:** `<InstallDir>\Game\UE_game\Torchlight\Saved\Logs\UE_game.log`

TITrack automatically checks common installation paths for both Steam and the standalone client. If the game is installed in a non-standard location, TITrack will prompt for the game directory on startup. The setting is saved to the database (`log_directory` in settings table) and persists across restarts.

**Flexible path input:** Users can provide the game root folder, the Logs folder, or the direct path to `UE_game.log` - TITrack will resolve any of these to the correct log file location.

**Key patterns to parse:**

Note: the log category prefix varies by game version. Historically `GameLog:`; as of SS12 Lunaria (season 1401) it's `TLLua:` for Lua events (BagMgr, ItemChange, SceneLevelMgr) and `TLShipping:` for LevelMgr. Patterns in `src/titrack/parser/patterns.py` accept any `\w+:` prefix.

```text
# Item pickup block
TLLua: Display: [Game] ItemChange@ ProtoName=PickItems start
TLLua: Display: [Game] BagMgr@:Modfy BagItem PageId = 102 SlotId = 0 ConfigBaseId = 100300 Num = 671
TLLua: Display: [Game] ItemChange@ ProtoName=PickItems end

# Inventory snapshot (triggered by sorting inventory in-game)
TLLua: Display: [Game] BagMgr@:InitBagData PageId = 102 SlotId = 0 ConfigBaseId = 100300 Num = 609

# Slot removal (last item in stack consumed - no ConfigBaseId/Num in this line)
TLLua: Display: [Game] BagMgr@:RemoveBagItem PageId = 103 SlotId = 39

# Map boundaries
LevelMgr@ EnterLevel ...
LevelMgr@ OpenLevel ...
```

**Parsing rules:**
- Incremental tail (handle log rotation)
- Delta = current `Num` - previous `Num` for same slot/item
- Tag changes inside PickItems block as "pickup-related"
- Handle unknown ConfigBaseIds gracefully (show as "Unknown <id>")
- `InitBagData` events update slot state but don't create deltas (used for inventory sync)
- `RemoveBagItem` events fire when a slot is fully emptied (last item consumed). Has no ConfigBaseId/Num — lookup existing slot state to determine what was removed, then treat as Num=0.
- Non-loot proto names (`Push2`, `XchgReceive`, `ExchangeItem`, `XchgRecall`, `XchgForSale`, `UnequipSkill`) update slot state but don't create deltas. These are trade house sales/listings, item recycling, cancelled listings, and skill management — not map loot.
- Events outside any `ProtoName` block (e.g., re-equipping a skill) update slot state but don't create deltas. All legitimate loot/cost events occur inside proto blocks.

## Database Schema (Core Tables)

- `settings` - key/value config
- `runs` - map instances (start_ts, end_ts, zone_sig, level_id, level_type, level_uid)
- `item_deltas` - per-item changes with run_id, context, proto_name
- `slot_state` - current inventory state per (page_id, slot_id)
- `items` - item metadata (name, icon_url, category)
- `prices` - item valuation (price_fe, source, updated_ts)
- `hidden_items` - items hidden from inventory display per player (player_id, config_base_id)
- `ignored_runs` - runs excluded from all calculations per player (player_id, run_id)
- `ignored_run_items` - specific item types excluded per run (player_id, run_id, config_base_id)
- `ignored_report_items` - item types excluded from loot report totals per player (player_id, config_base_id)

## Item Database

`tlidb_items_seed_en.json` contains 1,811 items with:
- `id` (ConfigBaseId as string)
- `name_en`, `name_cn`
- `img` (icon URL)
- `url_en`, `url_cn` (TLIDB links)

Seeds the `items` table on first run.

## File Locations

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `TI_Local_Loot_Tracker_PRD.md` | Complete requirements document |
| `tlidb_items_seed_en.json` | Item database seed (1,811 items) |

## Storage Locations (Runtime)

- Default: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TITracker\tracker.db`
- Portable mode: `.\data\tracker.db` beside exe

## Native Window Mode

The packaged EXE runs in a native window using pywebview (EdgeChromium on Windows) instead of opening in the default browser. This provides a cleaner user experience with no visible CLI window.

- **Window title**: "TITrack - Torchlight Infinite Loot Tracker"
- **Default size**: 1280x800, minimum 800x600
- **State persistence**: Window remembers position, size, and maximized state across restarts (settings keys: `window_position`, `window_size`, `window_maximized`)
- **Shutdown**: Closing the window gracefully stops all services
- **Browser fallback**: If WebView2 (EdgeChromium) is unavailable, the app shows a message box with a link to install the WebView2 Runtime and falls back to browser mode with an Exit button. The renderer is forced to EdgeChromium to prevent silent fallback to MSHTML (IE11) which cannot render modern CSS/JS.

For debugging, run with `--no-window` flag to use browser mode instead:
```bash
TITrack.exe --no-window
```

### Windows Mark of the Web (MOTW) Issue

Files downloaded from the internet are marked by Windows as untrusted. This can prevent pythonnet DLLs from loading, causing native window mode to fail.

**Solutions:**
1. **Use TITrack-Setup.exe** (recommended) - Downloads programmatically, no MOTW
2. **Unblock after extracting**: `Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\TITrack" -Recurse | Unblock-File`
3. **Code signing** - Signed executables bypass MOTW restrictions

## Mini-Overlay Mode

TITrack includes a compact always-on-top overlay window designed for users without multiple monitors who want to see stats while playing.

### Implementation

The overlay is a **separate native WPF application** (`TITrackOverlay.exe`) that communicates with the main TITrack backend via HTTP API. This architecture was chosen because pywebview/WebView2 cannot support true window transparency on Windows.

### Features

- **Always-on-top**: Stays above the game window (toggleable via pin button)
- **True transparency**: Full background transparency with text drop shadows for visibility
- **Compact layout**: Default 320x500px, resizable down to 180px wide with responsive padding
- **Frameless window**: Clean look without title bar, draggable via header
- **Click-through**: Stats and loot areas pass clicks to the game; header/buttons/resize remain interactive
- **Fast refresh**: Updates every 2 seconds
- **Previous run preservation**: When a map ends, loot and value are preserved with "Previous Run" label
- **Displays**:
  - All 6 header stats (Net Worth as whole number, others with 2 decimal places)
  - Current/previous run zone, duration, and value
  - Top 10 loot drops by value (FE value in green, quantity in gray)

### Launch Methods

**CLI flags**:
```bash
TITrack.exe --overlay        # Main window + overlay
TITrack.exe --overlay-only   # Just the overlay (no main dashboard)
```

**From UI**: Click the "Overlay" button in the dashboard header (only visible in native window mode).

### Technical Details

| Component | Details |
|-----------|---------|
| Technology | WPF (.NET 8) |
| Build | Self-contained single-file (~154 MB) |
| Communication | HTTP polling to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/*` |
| Endpoints used | `/api/runs/stats`, `/api/runs/active`, `/api/inventory` |
| Refresh interval | 2 seconds |

### Building the Overlay

```bash
# Self-contained (no .NET runtime required, ~154 MB)
dotnet publish overlay/TITrackOverlay.csproj -c Release -o overlay/publish

# Framework-dependent (requires .NET 8 runtime, ~200 KB)
dotnet publish overlay/TITrackOverlay.csproj -c Release -o overlay/publish -p:SelfContained=false
```

The PyInstaller spec automatically includes `overlay/publish/TITrackOverlay.exe` if it exists.

### Overlay Controls

- **A (small)**: Decrease text size (scales from 70% to 160%)
- **A (large)**: Increase text size
- **◐ button**: Toggle transparency (fully transparent background with white text and drop shadows)
- **⏸/▶ button**: Pause/resume realtime tracking (only visible when Real-Time Tracking is enabled)
- **📌 button**: Toggle always-on-top (pinned/unpinned)
- **✕ button**: Close overlay
- **Header area**: Drag to move window
- **Double-click header**: Reset window position
- **Corner grip**: Resize window (padding scales proportionally when shrinking below default size)
- **Stats/Loot areas**: Click-through (passes clicks to game underneath)
- **Hide Loot Pickups**: Toggle in Settings → Overlay to hide loot section for compact stats-only mode (overlay auto-resizes)

Font scale setting is persisted and restored when the overlay reopens.

### State Persistence

The overlay remembers its position, size, and transparency across restarts. State is saved to the settings API and restored on launch.

| State | Settings key | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| Normal overlay position | `overlay_position` | `"left,top"` |
| Normal overlay size | `overlay_size` | `"width,height"` |
| Micro overlay position | `overlay_micro_position` | `"left,top"` |
| Transparency | `overlay_transparent` | `"true"/"false"` |

- Position is saved after every drag and double-click reset
- Size is saved with a 500ms debounce during resize, and on close
- Position is validated against virtual screen bounds on load (falls back to default if off-screen)
- Micro overlay size is not persisted (auto-sized by content)

### Micro Overlay Mode

A compact alternative to the full overlay that shows only selected stats in a minimal bar. Configured entirely from Settings → Overlay.

**Settings:**
- **Micro Overlay toggle**: Switches between full and micro overlay (polled every 2 seconds)
- **Layout**: Horizontal (wide bar) or Vertical (narrow column with buttons on top)
- **Font size**: Slider from 70% to 160%, applied via ScaleTransform
- **Visible stats**: Clickable chips to select which stats appear; drag to reorder

**Available stats:** Time, FE/hr, Total, NW, Run, Val/Map, Runs, Avg

**Micro overlay controls:**
- **◐ button**: Toggle transparency
- **🔒 button**: Lock overlay (click-through)
- **✕ button**: Close overlay
- **Bar area**: Drag to move, double-click to reset position
- **Stats area**: Click-through (passes clicks to game)

**Settings keys:** `overlay_micro_mode`, `overlay_micro_stats` (JSON array), `overlay_micro_orientation`, `overlay_micro_font_scale`, `overlay_micro_position`

## Single Instance Enforcement

TITrack prevents multiple instances from running simultaneously to avoid duplicate data (e.g., map costs being recorded twice).

On startup, the app checks if port 8000 is already in use:
- **If TITrack is already running**: Shows error "TITrack is already running on port 8000. Please close the existing instance first."
- **If another app is using the port**: Shows error "Port 8000 is already in use by another application. Try running with --port <number> to use a different port."

Detection works by making a quick HTTP request to `/api/status` - if it responds with TITrack's status JSON, it's identified as an existing TITrack instance.

## Logging

All console output is redirected to a log file when running as a packaged EXE:
- **Portable mode**: `.\data\titrack.log` beside exe
- **Default**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\TITracker\titrack.log`

Log rotation:
- Maximum file size: 5MB
- Keeps 3 backup files (titrack.log.1, .2, .3)

In development mode (non-frozen), logs also output to console.

## MVP Requirements

1. Select & persist log file path
2. Tail log, parse PickItems + BagMgr updates
3. Compute deltas, store in DB
4. Segment runs (EnterLevel-based boundaries)
5. Display FE gained per run, profit/hr
6. Automatic price learning from Exchange searches
7. Net worth from latest inventory
8. Packaged portable EXE

- **Current Run Panel**: Live drops display during active map runs (sorted by value, shows costs when enabled)
- **Recent Runs**: Zone, duration, value with details modal (shows net value when costs enabled). Scrollable with sticky header (max 600px). Runs can be ignored (excluded from all calculations) via the details modal. Individual items within a run can also be ignored. Ignored runs show with strikethrough + dimmed styling; runs with ignored items show a small indicator icon.
- **Current Inventory**: Sortable by quantity or value, with "Hide Items" button to hide items from display (hidden items count toward net worth by default; toggle "Exclude from Net Worth" in the Hide Items modal to exclude them). Hide Items modal includes a search bar to filter items by name.

- **Settings Modal**: Trade Tax toggle, Map Costs toggle, Real-Time Tracking toggle, Overlay settings (Hide Loot Pickups), Game Directory configuration (with Browse button in native window mode)

## Loot Report

The "Report" button in the Recent Runs section opens a modal showing cumulative loot statistics across all runs since the last reset.

### Summary Stats

- **Gross Value**: Total value of all loot picked up in maps
- **Map Costs**: Total cost of compasses/beacons consumed (only shown if Map Costs setting enabled)
- **Profit**: Gross Value minus Map Costs
- **Runs**: Number of completed map runs
- **Total Time**: Combined duration of all map runs
- **Profit/Hour**: Profit divided by total time spent in maps
- **Profit/Map**: Average profit per map run
- **Unique Items**: Number of distinct item types collected

### Chart

A doughnut chart visualizes the top 10 items by value, with remaining items grouped as "Other". The legend shows item names with percentages.

### Table

A scrollable table lists all items with:
- Icon and name
- Quantity collected
- Unit price (from local or cloud pricing)
- Total value (quantity × unit price)
- Percentage of total value
- Ignore toggle (eye icon) to exclude item from report totals

Items without known prices show "--" and appear at the bottom.

### Ignore Items

Click the eye icon on any item row to exclude it from report totals, percentages, chart, and rate calculations. Ignored items appear dimmed with strikethrough. Totals recalculate instantly client-side. Items ignored in individual runs (via run details modal) are automatically pre-ignored in the report. State is per-character, persists across sessions, and clears on stats reset. Stored in `ignored_report_items` table.

### CSV Export

Click "Export CSV" to save the report. A native "Save As" dialog lets you choose the file location. The CSV includes:
- All items with quantities, prices, and values
- Summary section with all stats

### Data Filtering

- Only includes items picked up during map runs (excludes trade house purchases, crafting, etc.)
- Excludes non-loot events: trade house sales/listings (`Push2`, `XchgReceive`, `XchgForSale`), item recycling (`ExchangeItem`), skill equip/unequip (`UnequipSkill`), and events outside proto blocks — these update inventory/net worth but don't create deltas
- Excludes map costs (Spv3Open events) from loot totals
- Excludes gear page items (PageId 100), except allowlisted types (Destiny, Prisms, Divinity)
- Respects Trade Tax setting when calculating values

## Trade Tax

The Torchlight trade house takes a 12.5% tax (1 FE per 8 FE). Enable the "Trade Tax" toggle in Settings to see after-tax values:
- Applied to non-FE items only (FE currency is not taxed)
- Affects: Run values, inventory net worth, value/hour calculations
- Setting stored in database as `trade_tax_enabled`

## Map Costs

When enabled, TITrack tracks compass/beacon consumption when opening maps and Proof of the Brave consumption when entering Path of the Brave, and subtracts these costs from run values.

### How It Works

1. When you open a map with a compass/beacon, the game logs an `ItemChange@ ProtoName=Spv3Open` block. When entering Path of the Brave, the game logs `ProtoName=ClimbTowerOpen` instead.
2. TITrack captures these consumption events and associates them with the next map run
3. Run values show net profit (gross loot value minus map cost)

### Enabling Map Costs

Click the gear icon (Settings) in the header and enable "Map Costs" toggle.

### Display

When map costs are enabled:
- **Recent Runs table**: Shows net value (with warning icon if some costs are unpriced)
- **Run Details modal**: Shows map costs section with consumed items, followed by summary (Gross / Cost / Net)
- **Current Run panel**: Shows net value with cost breakdown
- **Stats**: FE/Hour and FE/Map reflect net values after costs

### Unknown Prices

If a consumed item doesn't have a known price:
- The item shows "?" instead of a value with tooltip
- A warning icon appears next to the run value
- The cost is excluded from calculations (only priced items are summed)
- Search the item on the Exchange to learn its price

### Settings

- Setting stored in database as `map_costs_enabled`
- Default: disabled (gross values shown)

## Real-Time Tracking

By default, TITrack calculates FE/Hour and Total Time using only in-map time (summed run durations). Real-Time Tracking mode uses wall-clock elapsed time instead, giving a more realistic view of session productivity including town/hideout time.

### Enabling Real-Time Tracking

Click the gear icon (Settings) in the header and enable "Real-Time Tracking" toggle.

### How It Works

When enabled:
- **Total Time** = wall-clock time from first run start to now, minus paused time (ticks continuously)
- **FE/Hour** = total value / real elapsed time (includes downtime between maps)
- **Avg Run Time** = unchanged (always uses in-map duration)
- **FE/Hour chart** = rolling window uses wall-clock duration instead of summed run durations

### Pause Button

When Real-Time Tracking is enabled, a pause button (⏸) appears next to Total Time in the dashboard header and in the overlay. Click to pause the timer during breaks; click again (▶) to resume. Paused time is excluded from calculations.

### Pause State

Pause state is stored via settings:
- `realtime_paused` — whether the timer is currently paused
- `realtime_total_paused_seconds` — accumulated paused time
- `realtime_pause_start` — timestamp when current pause began

Resetting stats clears all pause state.

### Settings

- Setting stored in database as `realtime_tracking_enabled`
- Default: disabled (in-map time only)

## Low Map Supply Alerts

Configurable alerts that notify when a specific consumed supply item drops to a set threshold. Only items actually consumed as map costs (via `Spv3Open`/`ClimbTowerOpen` proto names) are monitored — unused items in inventory won't trigger alerts.

### Categories

| Category | How items are identified |
|----------|------------------------|
| Beacons | Items with `type_cn = '信标'` in items table |
| Compasses | Items with `type_cn = '罗盘'` in items table |
| Resonance | Hardcoded ConfigBaseIds: `{5028, 5040}` |

Category ID sets are populated at startup by `initialize_supply_categories()` in `src/titrack/data/inventory.py`.

### How It Works

1. User sets per-category thresholds in Settings (0 = disabled)
2. Backend queries `item_deltas` for distinct items consumed via map cost proto names
3. Intersects with supply category IDs to get relevant consumed items
4. Returns each item's name, category, and current quantity from slot state
5. Frontend/overlay checks each item individually against its category's threshold

### Display

- **Dashboard**: Amber toast notification (15 seconds), shows item name and quantity
- **Full overlay**: Amber text banner (15 seconds auto-hide)
- **Micro overlay**: ⚠ icon with tooltip containing alert text (15 seconds auto-hide)

Alerts trigger once per item crossing the threshold and re-arm when quantity goes back above.

### Settings Keys

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `low_supply_beacon_threshold` | `"0"` | Alert when a consumed beacon drops to this count |
| `low_supply_compass_threshold` | `"0"` | Alert when a consumed compass drops to this count |
| `low_supply_resonance_threshold` | `"0"` | Alert when a consumed resonance item drops to this count |

### API

- `GET /api/inventory/supplies` — Returns consumed supply items with current quantities (`SupplyItemsResponse`)

## Zone Translation

Zone names are mapped in `src/titrack/data/zones.py`. The `ZONE_NAMES` dictionary maps internal zone path patterns to English display names. Use `/api/stats/zones` to see all encountered zones and identify which need translation.

## Price Seeding

Prices can be seeded on init: `titrack init --seed items.json --prices-seed prices.json`

Export current prices via `GET /api/prices/export`.

## Zone Differentiation

Some zones share the same internal path across different areas (e.g., "Grimwind Woods" appears in both Glacial Abyss and Voidlands with the same path `YL_BeiFengLinDi201`).

These are differentiated using `LevelId` from the game logs:
- The `LevelMgr@ LevelUid, LevelType, LevelId` line is parsed before zone transitions
- LevelId format: `XXYY` where `XX` = Timemark tier, `YY` = zone identifier
- For ambiguous zones, `level_id % 100` extracts the zone suffix to determine the region

### LevelId Structure

| Timemark | XX Value |
|----------|----------|

### Ambiguous Zone Suffixes

| Zone | Suffix | Region |
|------|--------|--------|
| Grimwind Woods | 06 | Glacial Abyss |
| Grimwind Woods | 54 | Voidlands |
| Elemental Mine | 12 | Blistering Lava Sea |
| Elemental Mine | 55 | Voidlands |
| Demiman Village | 02 | Glacial Abyss |

To add a new ambiguous zone:
1. Run the zone and check the log for `LevelMgr@ LevelUid, LevelType, LevelId = X Y ZZZZ`
2. The last 2 digits of LevelId are the zone suffix
3. Add the suffix mapping to `AMBIGUOUS_ZONES` in `src/titrack/data/zones.py`

For special zones (bosses, secret realms) that don't follow the XXYY pattern, add exact LevelId mappings to `LEVEL_ID_ZONES`. Path of the Brave uses LevelIds `999901`–`999905` (one per difficulty level) and reuses boss arena maps internally.

## Inventory Sync

To sync your full inventory with the tracker, use the **Sort** button in-game:
1. Open your inventory (bag)
2. Click the Sort/Arrange button (auto-organizes items)
3. The game logs `BagMgr@:InitBagData` lines for every slot
4. TITrack captures these and updates slot state without creating deltas

This is useful when:
- Starting the tracker for the first time (existing inventory not tracked)
- Inventory state gets out of sync
- You want to ensure accurate net worth calculation

## Player Info & Multi-Character Support

Player/character information is parsed from the main game log (`UE_game.log`). The parser looks for lines containing `+player+Name`, `+player+SeasonId`, etc.

- **Name**: Player's character name
- **SeasonId**: League/season identifier (mapped to display name in `player_parser.py`)

The dashboard displays the character name and season name in the header.

### Automatic Character Detection

TITrack detects characters in two ways:

1. **On startup**: Reads backwards through the existing game log to find the most recently logged-in character. If found, the character is detected immediately without requiring a relog.
2. **Live monitoring**: Watches the live log stream for player data lines as they appear. When a different character is detected, the collector switches context.

If no player data exists in the log (first time use, or log was deleted), the app shows "Waiting for character detection..." until the user logs in.

**Dependency on the in-game Enable Log toggle.** Torchlight only writes the verbose `+player+Exp ... +Name [...] +SeasonId [...]` block when the in-game **Settings → Enable Log** toggle is on at the moment the server's character-data packet arrives (on each login). Enable Log defaults to off and does not persist across client restarts, so the most common "detection failing" support case is: the user has logging off, or toggled it on after already being in-game. The fix is to have them toggle Enable Log on, exit to the Select Character screen, and log back in — the server re-sends the packet on every login, and the game will write it this time. No client restart is required in the typical case. A rarer edge case produces a truncated `+player+...` placeholder even with logging on; the fallback is a full Torchlight client restart (quit to desktop). The in-app "Character Not Detected" modal walks users through both recipes.

Inventories, runs, and prices are isolated per character/season.

### Data Isolation

Each character has isolated data using an **effective player ID**:
- If the log contains a `PlayerId`, that is used
- Otherwise, `{season_id}_{name}` is used as the identifier (e.g., `1301_MyChar`)

This ensures:
- **Inventory**: Each character has separate slot states
- **Runs/Deltas**: Tagged with season_id and player_id
- **Prices**: Isolated per season (seasonal vs permanent economies are separate)

### Migrating Legacy Prices

If you have prices from before multi-season support was added, they may be stored with `season_id=0`. To migrate them to your current season:

```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/prices/migrate-legacy
```

Run this while logged in as the character whose economy should receive the prices.

## Inventory Tab Filtering

The game inventory has 4 tabs identified by PageId:
- **PageId 100**: Gear (equipment) - **EXCLUDED from tracking** (with exceptions below)
- **PageId 101**: Skill
- **PageId 102**: Commodity (currency, crafting materials)
- **PageId 103**: Misc

The Gear tab is excluded because most gear prices depend on specific affixes. However, certain gear-tab item types with stable, tradeable prices are **allowlisted** and tracked normally:

- **Destiny**: Fates (Micro/Medium/Dual), Kismets, Undetermined Fate, Star Net, Wandering Star
- **Prisms**: Ethereal Prisms, Inverse Image, Prism Levels/Gauges/Repairer
- **Divinity**: Divinity Pacts, Divinity Fragments, God Divinities (Might, War, Machines, Deception)

The allowlist is defined by `type_cn` values in `ALLOWED_GEAR_TYPE_CN` in `src/titrack/data/inventory.py`. At startup, `initialize_gear_allowlist(db)` queries the items table to build a ConfigBaseId set. The `is_gear_excluded()` function checks both page exclusion and the allowlist.

Filtering is applied at:
- Collector level (bag events from excluded pages are skipped unless allowlisted)
- Repository queries (slot states, deltas, and loot reports filtered by default)

To add new allowlisted types, add `type_cn` values to `ALLOWED_GEAR_TYPE_CN` in `src/titrack/data/inventory.py`.

## Cloud Sync (Crowd-Sourced Pricing)

TITrack supports opt-in cloud sync to share and receive community pricing data.

### Features

- **Anonymous**: Uses device-based UUIDs, no user accounts required
- **Opt-in**: Disabled by default, toggle in the UI header
- **Offline-capable**: Works fully offline, syncs when connected
- **Cloud-first pricing**: Cloud prices are used by default, local prices override only when newer

### How It Works

1. When you search an item in the in-game Exchange, TITrack captures the prices
2. If cloud sync is enabled, the price data is queued for upload
3. Background threads upload your submissions and download community prices
4. Community prices are used for inventory valuation and run value calculations

**Note:** FE (Flame Elementium, ConfigBaseId 100300) is excluded from cloud sync entirely - it is the base currency and always valued at 1:1. This prevents bad submissions from corrupting sparklines or price calculations.

### Pricing Priority

The `get_effective_price()` method implements cloud-first pricing logic:

1. **Cloud price is the default** - Community aggregate (median) is more reliable
2. **Local price overrides only if newer** - Compares `local.updated_at` vs `cloud.cloud_updated_at`
3. If only one source exists, that price is used
4. If timestamp comparison fails, defaults to cloud price

This means:
- Fresh install with cloud sync enabled → uses cloud prices immediately
- You search an item in Exchange → local price saved with current timestamp
- If your local search is newer than cloud data → your price is used
- When cloud data is updated → cloud price takes over again

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/cloud/status` - Sync status, queue counts, last sync times
- `POST /api/cloud/toggle` - Enable/disable cloud sync
- `POST /api/cloud/sync` - Manual sync trigger
- `GET /api/cloud/prices` - Cached community prices
- `GET /api/cloud/prices/{id}/history` - Price history for sparklines

### Settings API

- `GET /api/settings/{key}` - Get setting (whitelisted keys only)
- `PUT /api/settings/{key}` - Update setting

### Database Tables (Cloud Sync)

- `cloud_sync_queue` - Prices waiting to upload
- `cloud_price_cache` - Downloaded community prices
- `cloud_price_history` - Hourly price snapshots for sparklines

### Settings Keys

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `cloud_sync_enabled` | `"false"` | Master toggle |
| `cloud_device_id` | (generated) | Anonymous device UUID (generated once per database, persists across updates/restarts; only registered in Supabase `device_registry` when a price is submitted) |
| `cloud_upload_enabled` | `"true"` | Upload prices to cloud |
| `cloud_download_enabled` | `"true"` | Download prices from cloud |

### Sparklines (Price Trend Charts)

The inventory panel shows sparkline charts in the "Trend" column when cloud sync is enabled. These mini-charts visualize price history over time.

**How sparklines work:**
1. When the inventory renders, sparkline canvases are created for items with cloud prices
2. History data is lazy-loaded from `/api/cloud/prices/{id}/history` for each item
3. Results are cached to avoid redundant fetches

**Visual indicators:**
- **Green line**: Price trending up (>1% increase from first to last point)
- **Red line**: Price trending down (>1% decrease)
- **Gray line**: Price stable (within ±1%)
- **Dashed gray line**: Insufficient history data (fewer than 2 data points)
- **Three dots**: Loading state while fetching history

**Sparkline vs. Community indicator:**
- **Sparklines** appear for any item with a cloud price (even single contributor)
- **Community indicator** (dot next to item name) only appears for prices with 3+ contributors

Click any sparkline to open the item's page on titrack.ninja in the browser. Item names in the inventory and loot report are also clickable links to titrack.ninja.

### Supabase Backend (Not Configured)

Cloud sync requires a Supabase backend. The backend is NOT configured by default. To enable:

1. Create a Supabase project
2. Run the SQL migrations to create tables and functions
3. Set environment variables:
   - `TITRACK_SUPABASE_URL` - Your project URL
   - `TITRACK_SUPABASE_KEY` - Your anon key
4. Or update the defaults in `src/titrack/sync/client.py`

Install the Supabase SDK: `pip install titrack[cloud]`

## Internationalization (i18n)

TITrack supports two languages: **English (en)** (default) and **Simplified Chinese (zh-CN)**. The language is selected from Settings → Language and persisted as the `language` setting. Both the web dashboard and the WPF overlay follow this setting.

### Translation surfaces

| Surface | Source |
|---------|--------|
| Web UI static strings | `src/titrack/web/static/i18n.js` `TRANSLATIONS` (~145 keys) |
| Overlay static strings | `overlay/Localization.cs` `Strings` |
| Item names | `items.name_en` / `items.name_cn` columns (from `tlidb_items_seed_en.json`) |
| Zone names | `src/titrack/data/zones.py` `ZONE_NAMES` (en) and `ZONE_NAMES_CN` (zh-CN) |
| Season / hero names | `src/titrack/parser/player_parser.py` `SEASON_NAMES_*` / `HERO_NAMES_*` |

### Selection rules

- Item name: prefer `name_cn` when language is zh-CN and non-empty; else `name_en`; else legacy `name`; else `Unknown ({id})`.
- Zone name: looked up by English display name. The runtime `(Nightmare)` suffix is preserved/translated separately so any zone can be displayed in Nightmare mode without duplicating entries.
- FE (Flame Elementium) is rendered as **源质** in zh-CN copy.

### API endpoints

- `GET /api/i18n/zones` — Returns `{ "zh-CN": { "<EnglishName>": "<译名>", ... } }`. Used by the web app and the overlay to translate zone display names client-side.
- `GET /api/settings/language` / `PUT /api/settings/language` — Round-trips the user's language choice. `language` is whitelisted in `ALLOWED_SETTINGS`.

### Adding a new translation

1. **UI string**: add the key to both language blocks in `src/titrack/web/static/i18n.js` and `overlay/Localization.cs`. Use it in templates via `data-i18n="key"` (web) or `Localization.Tr("key")` (overlay).
2. **Zone**: add an entry to `ZONE_NAMES_CN` in `src/titrack/data/zones.py`. The endpoint serves the dict as-is.
3. **Item**: name_cn comes from the seed JSON. Re-seeding pulls fresh translations.
4. **Season / hero**: extend the `*_NAMES_CN` dicts in `src/titrack/parser/player_parser.py`.

### Overlay behaviour

The overlay polls `/api/settings/language` every refresh tick (~2 s). When the value changes, `Localization.LanguageChanged` fires and `MainWindow.ApplyLanguageLabels()` re-applies all static labels and tooltips in place — no restart required.

## Known Limitations / TODO

- **Timemark level not tracked**: The game log zone paths are identical regardless of Timemark level (e.g., 7-0 vs 8-0). Runs of the same zone are grouped together. To support per-Timemark tracking, would need to find another log line that indicates the Timemark level (possibly when selecting beacon or starting map) or add manual run tagging in the UI.
- **Cloud sync backend not configured**: The Supabase backend URLs/keys need to be configured before cloud sync will work.
